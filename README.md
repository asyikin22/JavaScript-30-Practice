# Array Practice 4 
* This file demonstrates how I use array method to manipulate data. Those methods are:
   1. Filter people who were born in the 1500 using __'filter'__ method
   2. Creating an array of inventor with thier first name and last name using __'map'__ method
   3. Sorting the name of inventor by thier birth year, from the oldest to the youngest by using __'sort'__ method.
   4. Calculate how many years did all the inventors live by using __'reduce'__ method.
   5. Sort inventors by the years they have lived from the oldest to the youngest using __'sort'__ method
   6. Sum up the instances of each item in the data using __'reduce'__ method. It will tally up the total of each item.
