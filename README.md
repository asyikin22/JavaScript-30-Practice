# Array Practice 4 
* This file demonstrates how I use array method to manipulate data. Those methods are:
   1. Filter people who were born in the 1500 using __'filter'__ method
   2. Creating an array of inventor with thier first name and last name using __'map'__ method
   3. Sorting the name of inventor by thier birth year, from the oldest to the youngest by using __'sort'__ method.
   4. Calculate how many years did all the inventors live by using __'reduce'__ method.
   5. Sort inventors by the years they have lived from the oldest to the youngest using __'sort'__ method
   6. Sum up the instances of each item in the data using __'reduce'__ method. It will tally up the total of each item.
 
# Array Practice 7 
* This file demonstrates more methods in manipulating data in array. Those methods are:
   1. Find out if there is at least one person who is 35 years old by using  __'map'__ method
        * before finding that out, I calculate the age of 5 people listed in the array and store the calculated age in variable called 'modified array'
        * I then used  __'some'__ method to find out if there is anyone at least 35 years old and the value returned in the console will be either 'false' or 'true'. in this case, it's true.
   2. I use  __'every'__ method to find out if everyone is 18, in this instance the value is false
   3. Find comment that has id:111111 using  __'find'__ method and an arrow function (the shortest method)
   4. Find comment that has id:555555 using  __'find'__ method and an anonymous function + conditional statement
   5. Find ID that has commet 'Rice is my fav food ever' using __'find'__ method
   6. Delete a comment that has id:222222 using __'delete'__ method. The new array will be reflected in the console - that particular comment is no longer there in the list
